    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>The growing demand for automated vehicle identification systems has highlighted the importance of efficient license plate detection. Such systems play a critical role in various applications, including law enforcement for tracking stolen vehicles, parking management for efficient space utilization, and traffic monitoring for maintaining road safety <a href="#reference1">[1]</a>. This project aims to develop a license plate detection system.</p>

    <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
    <p>The goal of this project is to develop a license plate detection system that accurately identifies and localizes license plates in diverse environments, considering varying lighting conditions, angles, and potential occlusions. This system is designed to enhance automated vehicle identification and contribute to applications in law enforcement, parking management, and traffic monitoring.</p>

    <h3>Approach</h3>
    <p>To achieve effective license plate detection, we will utilize a combination of image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms. The approach will involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> We will compile a dataset of images containing vehicles with clearly visible license plates, sourced from publicly available datasets, such as Kaggle <a href="#reference2">[2]</a> or Dataset Ninja <a href="#reference3">[3]</a>. The dataset will include state and pictures, examples are U.S. license plates include Car License Plate Dataset <a href="#reference4">[4]</a> and US License Plates <a href="#reference5">[5]</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> The images will undergo several preprocessing steps to enhance quality and ensure consistency, including:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Noise Reduction:</strong> Techniques such as Gaussian blur and median filtering will be employed to eliminate unwanted artifacts and enhance clarity.</li>
          <li><strong>Color Space Transformation:</strong> Images will be converted to color spaces like HSV or LAB to improve the visibility of license plates under different lighting conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Edge Detection Techniques:</strong> To further highlight the boundaries of the license plates and characters, edge detection methods such as the Canny edge detector will be applied.</li>
          <li><strong>Windowing Around Letters:</strong> A sliding window technique will be used to focus specifically on regions containing potential characters.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Detection Model:</strong> We will implement a deep learning-based object detection architecture, specifically selecting YOLOv5 <a href="#reference6">[6]</a> due to its balance between speed and accuracy for real-time applications.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> The model's performance will be evaluated primarily on its precision in detecting the actual license number plate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Plans for Experiments</h3>
    <p>The experiments will be structured as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dataset Preparation:</strong> We will ensure a diverse range of license plate designs and conditions in our dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Implementation:</strong> The detection algorithm will be implemented in Python.</li>
      <li><strong>Success Metrics:</strong> Success will be defined as achieving a detection accuracy above 70% on the test dataset.</li>
      <li><strong>Model Optimization:</strong> Data augmentation techniques will be employed to improve model robustness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
    <p>We expect to develop a working prototype capable of detecting and localizing license plates from vehicle images accurately.</p>

    <h3>Future Work</h3>
    <p>Potential future enhancements may include integrating the license plate detection system into larger traffic management solutions or improving its performance by fine-tuning the model with additional data collected in different environmental conditions.</p>
